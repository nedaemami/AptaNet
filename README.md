Right now it is not useable as is. 
I am in the process of fixing it and trying to use it.  


Dependencies, that I know of so far: 

pip install matplotlib

pip install sklearn

pip install pandas

pip install imblearn

pip install repDNA

pip install keras


Sidenotes: 

repDNA has some pitfalls

On Windows you need to elevate your CMD. 
You also might need to change some files of repDNA, so you won't get "Module not found" Errors. 
See my fork of repDNA for the fix.
