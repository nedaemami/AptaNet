# AptaNet
AptaNet as a Deep Learning approach for Aptamer-Protein Interaction Prediction

Repository to following paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85629-0#Sec23


Help 
===

- This Deep Learning solution uses TensorFlow
- https://www.tensorflow.org/


- Right now it is not useable as is. 
- I am in the process of fixing it and trying to use it.  



Dependencies, that I know of so far: 
===

- pip install matplotlib

- pip install sklearn

- pip install pandas

- pip install imblearn

- pip install repDNA

- pip install keras


Sidenotes:

repDNA has some pitfalls

On Windows you need to elevate your CMD. 
You also might need to change some files of repDNA, so you won't get those "Module not found" errors. 
See my fork of repDNA for the fix.
